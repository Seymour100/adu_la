    "# Los Angeles City Civic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to perform any sort of analysis or modeling of LA City land use issues is not just a exercise in exploratory data analysis and model building, its an exercise in data discovery and extraction. When I first came across <a href='https://data.lacity.org'>https://data.lacity.org</a>, with its over 1,000 datasets I thought that I would have pretty much everything I needed in one location to model the probabilty that an ADU (accesory dwelling unit), once someone applies for a permit, would be completed (see my post \"Predicting ADU Completion\"). Not so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking my clues about which factors influence ADU development projects from a design and architecture <a href='https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/design-and-architecture/dodger-stadium-upgrades-an-adu-is-born/at-long-last-an-adu-is-born-in-highland-park'>segment</a> on my local public radio station KCRW I soon realized that I would need to source data about building permits, parcel sizes, median incomes, historic preservation overlay zones and hillside ordinances. All of these datasets are maintained by different government entities. Some of the municipal services that we enjoy are provisioned by the city and others by the county. They each have their own data hubs (LA county's is <a href='https://data.lacounty.gov'>data.lacounty.gov</a>). They both contain some demographic data from the US Census, but without knowing how frequently it is updated I thought it better to source that data from the Census Bureau itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it was quite straight forward to download some datasets, I found the API's provided for others to be querky at best. And then when the time came to merge them  together I often found that the most logical common key shared by two datasets to be represented differently in each. This post is meant to be a roadmap for anyone wanting to take advantage of the trove of publicly available data for the city of Los Angeles in order to understand, and improve, what makes our city tick."

    "# Building Permit Data\n",
    "Luckily I had found on the LA City data hub what looked like to be a curated dataset of ADU permits applied for and issued during the six months between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. At the onset of this project I though I could create my own dataset of ADU projoects from the larger dataset of all LA city building permits, but I don't believe there was a single identifying code for ADU's in LA's permitting system. Also, the ADU may be part of a larger project and permitted as such. Thankfully some helpful soul in the LA City IT department identified six months of permits for ADU's, most likely for someone's study, and isolated them into their own public data set. The status of all the permits in this set are updated once a week since their issuance. "

    "## Socrata API and managing the rate limits\n",
    "The ADU dataset that I'm going to work with contains geospatial data that will have to be manipulated later, although not a geospatial databaser per se. Many of the non-geospatial datasets I've run across on municipal sites use the Socrata API. There is quite a bit of documentation available, even regarding this <a href='https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.lacity.org/r9zn-9ttc'>dataset</a> specifically (scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the \"Python Pandas\" tab). When I first downloaded this data set I found that the rate limiting employed would not allow me to extract the entire dataset in one go. Given that set is fairly small (7,778 records) I found the rate limiting to be rather sever.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get around this issue, and pull the entire dataset directly into memory, I had to write a loop that extracted chunks of it at a time. This knowledge came from this very helpful <a href='http://holowczak.com/getting-started-with-nyc-opendata-and-the-socrata-api/5/'>post</a> (see \"Paging Through Data\") by <a href='http://holowczak.com/about-me/'>Rich Holowczak</a> who was having the same issue with New York City data. Good to know that I'm not alone.\n",

    "First let's download the data. I'd like to use median household income data in my model. The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/api-user-guide/api-guide.pdf\"> Census Data API User Guide</a> is a nice document that explains how their API works, but before writing any Python code I first  use their <a href=\"https://data.census.gov/cedsci/advanced\">GUI</a> query tool to get a feel of what is available. The API User Guide refers you to a their <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/developers/updates/new-discovery-tool.html\">Discory Tool</a>, which, unless I'm missing something, is basically a very long list of data sets in various formats. I use the <a href=\"https://api.census.gov/data.html\">html verion</a>. After some research I learned that I want to use the American Community Survey - 5 year data for median income. I go to that table in the Discovery Tool and start looking through the <a href=\"https://api.census.gov/data/2009/acs/acs5/variables.html\">variables</a>. Oh my, a table that is even longer than the previous one. So long that it takes Chrome serval seconds to do a key word search of the page. So I start using command-F to search for the terms \"income\", \"median income\", \"household income\". I finally find what looks to be the correct variable name - B19013.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to do this is to use an API wrapper. There are a few out there for US Census data. In fact, at the bottom of the API User Guide they refer you to this <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/census/0.5/\">one</a>. I however used <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/CensusData/\">censusdata</a>. I think it is most useful in searching through the census tables. As you will see below, you can query specific words and phrases and it generating a list of tables and names. This was how I locate B19013_001E as the table for household median income.\n",
    "\n",
    "I make a few spot checks against the GUI for specific tracks - they matched! So I am confident that this is the data I should be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes time to download a dataset of median income for all census tracts in Los Angeles, I decide to use the requests library and not a wrapper. So following the API User Guide I construct the correct URL. I find it helpful to first play around with the syntax in my browser. It is just a quick way to fiddle the url so until it is correct before pulling the data into my notebook with requests."

Did someone use the wrong address when they looked up the census_tract, when it should be totally different, or did they look up the street address wrong when they recorded it, and then got the census_tract wrong by one digit.

    "# LA County Parcel Data and Joining on APN\n",
    "One of the features I would like to add to my ADU predictive model is lot size. My intuition is that it is easier to build on a larger lot due to having more space on which to maneuver. For this I've gone to the LA County Geohub where <a href=\"https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/6d85cb5f5f5641c6aa95203849ca05bb_0?geometry=-128.604%2C32.202%2C-107.994%2C35.396\">detailed parcel records</a> can be found. This data set has over 2.4 million records with ninety-one columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier in this post, sometimes the same data is hosted on both the county and the city datahubs. This is the case with parcel data. The LA City datahub has two data sets of parcels, <a href=\"https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::parcels\">one with all 2.4 million records</a>, and only the ability to download the file, presumably due to its size, and <a href=\"https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/la-city-parcels?geometry=-120.986%2C33.625%2C-115.833%2C34.422\">another</a> with just the parcels in LA City. This reduces the record count to 882K, but for some reason this data set has fewer columns. LA City provides an an API to query this data set directly. Unfortunately the one column I was hoping to get, the size of the lot, isn't present. Overall I'm finding that the LA City data hub does a better job of documentation, and given the sometimes unintelligible naming of columns, this can be a great asset. Given that it seems as if LA City has reproduced the complete parcel data set from the county, I choose to source the data from its owner - LA County."

    "As it turns out merging the geospatial data into the ADU data set was the easier than the key word merges. Of course I'm not doing the say validation in this merge as I did with the others. One could geo-locate the address of every ADU record, create a point with a buffer around, and then check to see if the lat-long data provided in the ADU dataset actually falls within the buffer. In a production setting where the validity of the locations is critical I would write a function that does this, but for the purpose of what I wanted to accomplish here, what we've done should be sufficient.\n",

    "So we've gone through an example of assembling a data set of building permit data from the city of Los Angeles, parcel details from the county of Los Angeles, demographic data from the US Census and geospatial data from the city. We've also seen how to merge data set on a key, check the validity of the key itself, and how to perform a spatial join to include regional characteristics in a data set. This covers many of the situations you would need to build an interesting data set from multiple sources to address civic issues in the city of Los Angeles."
